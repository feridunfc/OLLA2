# MultiAI v5 Architecture Overview

## Core Principles
- Hybrid AI Routing (local + cloud)
- Deterministic Ledger & Manifest Control
- Multi-tenant & Compliance Layer

## Components
1. **Hybrid Router** – task routing between OpenAI, Anthropic, or local LLMs.
2. **Manifest System** – deterministic build & risk validation.
3. **Enterprise Layer** – multi-tenant isolation, compliance checks, reporting.
